This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This project is using both the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and the [New York Times API](https://developer.nytimes.com/apis)

First you have to setup your `.env.local` with the proper env variable, you can use `.env.example` as a reference.

Then you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
